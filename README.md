# Google-Assistant
My first python project which is a replica version of famous Google assistant. This can do variety of tasks on your speech recognition, you can talk to it using your microphone. It can open any app or website from google on command you just have to say it. I have added only 4 websites but you can add more. It can also play songs from the music libarary file which has the songs' URLs you can add as many as you want it to play. Also you can add your own opanai's API, weather API and news API to get 4 to 5 headlines summarized, get weather updates in your city and from gpt you can ask anything. Also from wikipedia in it you can ask for any person or anything. It will give you its wikipedia summary of 2 to 3 lines. You can also set reminders and add notes and use basic system commands as well as ask date and time also it can tell you a refreshing joke. You can add more functionality if you want.
